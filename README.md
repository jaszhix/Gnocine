# Gnocine

This is a GNOME Shell extension providing a compatible environment for Cinnamon extensions. This work is based off of the progress [lestcape](https://github.com/lestcape/Classic-Gnome) and I started, but this repository was created due to a conflict in directions.

Instead of replacing GNOME Shell entirely with Cinnamon, this project will complement GNOME Shell with extended compatibility. GNOME Shell/GTK3 themes are planned to be supported with the Cinnamon panels and xlets. In addition to Cinnamon compatibility, this project will bring developer friendly tools such as ES2015 polyfills and modern libraries to GNOME Shell and Cinnamon extensions.

This is currently unstable and experimental software, use at your own risk.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04/16.04.1 with Gnome Shell 3.18.5, and 3.20.4.

## Testing

Currently Gnocine requires the Cinnamon package as a dependency while it is in the early stages.
