# Gnocine

This is a GNOME Shell extension providing a compatible environment for Cinnamon extensions. This work is based off of the progress [lestcape](https://github.com/lestcape/gnocine) and I started, but this repository was created due to a difference of opinions.

GNOME Shell/GTK3 themes are planned to be supported with the Cinnamon panels and xlets. In addition to Cinnamon compatibility, this project will bring developer friendly tools such as ES2015 polyfills and modern libraries to GNOME Shell and Cinnamon extensions.

This is currently unstable and experimental software, use at your own risk.
